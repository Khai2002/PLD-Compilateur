# PLD Compilateur



## Description
A compiler for a subset of C written in C++ using ANTLR4 for parsing.

## Installation

- ANTLR4: This is used for generating the parser for the C compiler. You can install it using your distribution's package manager or by running the provided shell script: `install-antlr.sh.`

- A C++ compiler: This is used to compile the C++ code in the project. The project has been tested with GCC on Linux.

## Usage
To use the C compiler, follow these steps:

Build the project by running make in the `compiler/` directory. This will generate the parser using ANTLR and compile the C++ code.

Run the compiler on a C file by using the following command:

` ./ifcc <filename>`

Replace `<filename>` with the path to the C file you want to compile. The C file should contain a main function that returns an integer.

For example, if you have a file `test.c` in the `compiler/` directory that contains the following code:

You can compile it by running:
`./ifcc test.c`

This will generate assembly code for the C program.

Please note that the compiler currently only supports a minimal subset of the C language. 

## Supported functionalities

   - Declaration of variables of type INT and CHAR
   - Basic arithmetic operations with priorities :
      - Addition
      - Subtraction
      - Multiplication
   - Division and modulus
   - Bitwise logical operations: OR (|), AND (&), XOR (Ë†)
   - Comparison operations: Equal (==), Not equal (!=), Less than (<), Greater than (>)  
   - Declaration of variables anywhere
   - Assignment (which also returns a value in C)
   - Use of standard functions putchar and getchar for input/output
   - Definition of functions with parameters, and return type int or void
   - Checking the consistency of function calls and their parameters
   - Block structure using { and }
   - Control structures: if, else, while
   - Support for return expression anywhere
   - Verification that a used variable has been declared
   - Verification that a variable is not declared multiple times
   - Verification that a declared variable is used
   - Simple constant propagation
   - Support of the char data type (8-bit integer)
   - Ability to initialize a variable at the time of its declaration
   - Assignment operators +=, -=, etc., increment ++ and decrement operators --   



## Under development
- Unary operations: Logical NOT (!) and Negation (-)
- Support for variable scopes and shadowing
- Retargeting to multiple architectures: X86 ,  ARM

## Tests 

To run the tests please go to the tests Folder and execute the following command: python3 ifcc-test.py [Path to the tests you want to compile]

## note 

For those who are on WSL : please run this command before running all the tests :
